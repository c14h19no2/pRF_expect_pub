# pRF_expect Project

This repository contains code and analysis for the pRF_expect project. It is organized as two related components:

- `pRF_expect_analysis/` — analysis code, notebooks and utilities for processing and analyzing pRF data and model outputs.
- `pRF_expect_exp/` — experiment code and tools used to run behavioral/scan sessions and generate task/run files.

Each component has its own detailed README.
